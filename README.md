# Sprinting Task Model

This project implements a basic task scheduling and execution framework inspired by thermal sprinting models in multiprocessor systems.

## Structure
- `Task`: represents a unit of work over one epoch.
- `TaskState`: enumerates task states.
- `TaskRunner`: runs tasks sequentially and manages state transitions.
